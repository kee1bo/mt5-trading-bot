# ü§ñ **HOW THE MT5 TRADING BOT WORKS - COMPLETE EXPLANATION**

*A comprehensive guide explaining exactly what your trading bot does, how it makes decisions, and how it manages risk.*

## üéØ **WHAT IS THIS BOT?**

Think of this trading bot as a **digital trader** that never sleeps, never gets emotional, and can analyze market data faster than any human. It's like having 5 expert traders working simultaneously, each with their own strategy, all trading XAUUSD (Gold) 24/7.

## üß† **THE BOT'S "BRAIN" - HOW IT THINKS**

### **The Main Loop (Every 50-200 milliseconds):**
```
1. üëÄ Look at the latest gold prices
2. üßÆ Calculate technical indicators (moving averages, momentum, etc.)
3. ü§î Ask each of the 5 strategies: "Should we trade now?"
4. üõ°Ô∏è Check risk limits: "Is it safe to trade?"
5. üí∞ If yes, place the trade with stop loss and take profit
6. üìä Update statistics and repeat
```

This happens **5-20 times per second** - much faster than any human could react!

## üë• **THE 5 "VIRTUAL TRADERS" (Strategies)**

Each strategy is like a specialist trader with their own expertise:

### **1. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è "Speed" - The Aggressive Scalper**
**What he does:** Looks for tiny, quick price movements
**How he decides:**
- Watches 5-minute and 10-minute moving averages
- **Buys** when short average goes above long average + momentum is positive
- **Sells** when short average goes below long average + momentum is negative
- Waits 3 seconds between trades (no spam)

**His trades:**
- **Stop Loss:** $0.10 per lot (10 points)
- **Take Profit:** $0.15 per lot (15 points)
- **Risk:** 0.5% of account per trade
- **Max trades:** 4 at once

**Example:** With $10,000 account, risks $50 per trade, position size ‚âà 5 lots

### **2. üí• "Momentum" - The Breakout Hunter**
**What he does:** Catches big price movements when they start
**How he decides:**
- Measures how fast price is moving over 10 minutes

- **Sells** when price rises above upper band AND RSI shows overbought (> 70)
- Bets on price returning to average

**His trades:**

### **5. ‚ö° "Flash" - The High-Frequency Scalper**
**What he does:** Makes lightning-fast micro-trades
**How he decides:**
- Uses ultra-fast 3-minute vs 8-minute averages
- **Buys** when 3-min average > 8-min average + tiny price movement up
- **Sells** when 3-min average < 8-min average + tiny price movement down
- No delays, instant execution

**His trades:**
- **Stop Loss:** $0.05 per lot (5 points)

- **Risk:** 0.3% of account per trade
- **Max trades:** 3 at once

**Example:** With $10,000 account, risks $30 per trade, position size ‚âà 6 lots

## üí∞ **POSITION SIZING - HOW MUCH MONEY PER TRADE**

The bot calculates position size using this formula:

```
Risk Amount = Account Balance √ó Risk Percentage
Position Size = Risk Amount √∑ Stop Loss Distance
Maximum Position = 10 lots (safety limit)
```

**Real Example with $25,000 account:**
- **Speed (0.5% risk):** $125 √∑ 10 points = 12.5 lots ‚Üí **Limited to 10 lots**
- **Momentum (0.8% risk):** $200 √∑ 20 points = **10 lots**
- **Crossover (1.0% risk):** $250 √∑ 25 points = **10 lots**
- **Contrarian (0.7% risk):** $175 √∑ 15 points = **11.7 lots ‚Üí Limited to 10 lots**
- **Flash (0.3% risk):** $75 √∑ 5 points = **15 lots ‚Üí Limited to 10 lots**

## üîç **COMMON QUESTIONS ANSWERED**

### **Q: Why doesn't every signal become a trade?**
**A:** Several reasons:
1. **Position limits reached** (e.g., Speed already has 4 trades)
2. **Risk limits exceeded** (total risk > 10%)
3. **Insufficient margin** (not enough money in account)
4. **AutoTrading disabled** in MT5
5. **Market closed** (outside trading hours)

### **Q: How does it know when to close trades?**
**A:** Three ways:
1. **Take Profit hit** (price reaches profit target) ‚úÖ WIN
2. **Stop Loss hit** (price reaches loss limit) ‚ùå LOSS  
3. **Manual close** (you close it yourself)

### **Q: What if the internet disconnects?**
**A:** 
- **Existing trades:** Stay open in MT5 with their stop loss/take profit
- **New trades:** Bot stops placing them until reconnected
- **Resume:** Bot automatically reconnects and continues

### **Q: Can I adjust the risk?**
**A:** Yes! Edit the configuration:
```python
# In production_multi_strategy.py
'aggressive_scalp': {
    'risk_per_trade': 0.5,  # Change to 0.3 for less risk
    'max_positions': 4,     # Change to 2 for fewer trades
}
```

### **Q: What's the minimum account size?**
**A:** 
- **Demo:** Any amount (for testing)
- **Live:** $1,000 minimum (but $5,000+ recommended)
- **Reason:** Need enough margin for multiple positions
