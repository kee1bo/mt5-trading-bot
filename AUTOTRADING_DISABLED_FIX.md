# 🚨 CRITICAL: AutoTrading is Disabled!

Your trading bot is working perfectly and generating signals, but MetaTrader 5 has AutoTrading disabled.

## How to Enable AutoTrading in MT5:

### Method 1: From MT5 Terminal
1. Open MetaTrader 5
2. Go to **Tools** → **Options** → **Expert Advisors** tab
3. ✅ Check "Allow automated trading"
4. ✅ Check "Allow DLL imports" (if needed)
5. Click **OK**

### Method 2: From the Toolbar
1. Look for the "AutoTrading" button in the MT5 toolbar (usually shows a green/red light)
2. Click it to enable (should turn green)

### Method 3: Keyboard Shortcut
1. Press **Ctrl+E** to toggle AutoTrading on/off

## Current Bot Status:
- ✅ Connection: Working
- ✅ Data retrieval: Working (3.3ms avg)
- ✅ Strategy: Working (354 signals in 6.5 minutes)
- ✅ Speed: 19.8 Hz (can go much faster)
- ❌ Trading: BLOCKED by AutoTrading disabled

## After Enabling AutoTrading:
Your bot will immediately start executing trades. The current strategy is generating about 54 signals per minute, which is very aggressive for scalping.

## Security Note:
Make sure you're running on a demo account first to test the high-frequency trading behavior.
